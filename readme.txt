2. OVERVIEW

This readme describes how to use the files that come with XAPP1165

This is a reference design that follows Xilinx revision control recommendations
for IP management, design implementation in Non-Project and Project Flow.

vcs_ip_location subdirectory includes all IPs used in the example designs and
a Tcl script for scanning all IP files and creating a batch file to check them
into a Git repository

vcs_non_project subdirectory incldues the example design in Non-Project flow
and a Tcl script to implement the design as well as creating a batch file to
check in all design sources and scripts into a Git repository.

vcs_project subdirectory incldues the example design in Project flow
and Tcl scripts to recreate the project and create a batch file to
check in all design sources and scripts into a Git repository.

5. INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 

1) Install the Xilinx Vivado 2013.2 or later tools.

vcs_ip_location
---------------
1) Open Vivado command prompt
2) Go to vcs_ip_location directory and run the command below to generate the
   batch git_batch.bat

   vivado -notrace -mode batch -source git_manage_ip.tcl

3) Open a git bash window and go to vcs_ip_location directory
4) Run git_batch.bat to check in all IP files

vcs_non_project
-----------------
1) Open Vivado command prompt
2) Go to vcs_no_project directory and create a directory "run"
3) Go to "run" directory and run the command below to implement the design

   vivado -mode batch -source ../script/vivado_non_project.tcl -notrace -tclargs -cmd run -ifn ../script/file_list.txt -top spectrum_top -part xc7k325tffg900-2

4) Go to "script" directory and run the command below to generate the batch 
   file git_batch.bat to check in all design files

   vivado -mode batch -source ../script/vivado_non_project.tcl -notrace -tclargs -cmd vcs -ifn file_list.txt -top spectrum_top -part xc7k325tffg900-2 -out git_batch.bat

5) Open a git bash window and go to vcs_non_project/script directory
4) Run git_batch.bat to check in all design files

vcs_project
-----------------
1) Open Vivado command prompt
2) Go to vcs_project directory
3) Run the command below to create the Vivado project for the design

   vivado -source script/spectrum_vv_prj_flow.tcl -notrace

4) Go to "script" directory and run the command below to generate the batch 
   file git_batch.bat to check in all design files

   vivado -mode batch -source git_project.tcl -notrace -tclargs -cmd vcs -ifn file_list.txt -out git_batch.bat

5) Open a git bash window and go to vcs_non_project/script directory
